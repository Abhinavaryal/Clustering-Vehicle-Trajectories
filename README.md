# Clustering Vehicle Trajectories

## Overview
This project clusters vehicle trajectories using a dataset generated by the SUMO traffic simulator. The dataset represents the movement of vehicles through the intersection at West University Avenue and Buckman Drive/NW 17th St., Gainesville, FL. The primary objectives are to perform spatial and temporal clustering to understand vehicle movement patterns.

## Dataset
- **Source**: SUMO Traffic Simulator
- **Data Structure**:
  - `cur_time`: Simulation time in deciseconds.
  - `vehicle_id`: Unique identifier for vehicles.
  - `x_cord`, `y_cord`: Spatial coordinates of vehicles.
  - `cluster`: Ground-truth cluster ID for trajectory.
  - `entry` and `maneuver`: Vehicle approach direction and turn type.
  - `signal`: Traffic signal state (Red: 0, Yellow: 1, Green: 3.0).

---

## Objectives
1. **Spatial Clustering**:
   - Perform clustering using simple features (`entry`, `maneuver`).
   - Extract trajectory-based features (e.g., min/max X, Y, first/last points).
   - Apply and compare clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN).

2. **Temporal Clustering**:
   - Compute total time taken by vehicles to cross the intersection.
   - Normalize time data and cluster based on speed patterns.

## Steps
### Data Loading
- Use `pandas` to load and inspect the dataset (`read_csv` and `groupby` functions).

### Spatial Clustering
1. **Initial Clustering**:
   - Group data by `entry` and `maneuver` columns.
   - Identify clusters based on valid lane-turn combinations.
2. **Trajectory-Based Clustering**:
   - Extract key features like min/max X, Y, start/end points.
   - Apply K-Means and DBSCAN for clustering.
   - Use `Adjusted Rand Score` to compare predicted clusters with ground truth.

### Temporal Clustering
1. **Feature Creation**:
   - Calculate total crossing time using `cur_time`.
2. **Clustering**:
   - Normalize crossing times using `MinMaxScaler`.
   - Apply K-Means clustering to identify speed patterns.

## Outputs
- **Visualizations**:
  - `x_cord` vs. `cur_time` (West-East movement).
  - `y_cord` vs. `cur_time` (South-North movement).
  - `x_cord` vs. `y_cord` (complete trajectory paths).
  - Cluster visualizations for spatial and temporal analyses.
- **Reports**:
  - Comparison of clustering results with ground-truth data.
  - Performance insights and conclusions.
